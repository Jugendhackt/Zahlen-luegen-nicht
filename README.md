### Risk Literacy Game • Risiko Kompetenz Spiel  
Living in the 21st century we are constantly being bombarded with misleading statistics. With this classroom app designed for students we hope to turn students into “risk-literate” citizens that are aware of statistical fallacies and the myriad ways in which data is being abused and cherry-picked that can give us a false picture of something or even lead us to draw false conclusions. Students are lead through a series of stories and statistics (politics, tech, medicine, environment) in which they are able to choose a character that they want to represent (e.g. "CEO of the company X", "CEO of the company Y", "Professor of Statistics" or simply "Student"). The user is then presented with various diagrams that show the dataset being represented in various ways (some misleading; some not). A "CEO of company X" might want to show stats about companies like his differently than a Prof. of Statistics" would - perhaps a graph with a y-Axis starting at a value higher than 0. (while as a "Proffesor of Statistics" hopefully wants to show the data in the most objective way possible). Story after story students will develop the instinct of questioning stats that is thrown at them.
